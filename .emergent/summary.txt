-   **Lifestyle & Behaviour Support**: Track sleep, food, exercise, stress, and provide rule-based suggestions and reminders.
-   **Information Library**: Structured, searchable articles on menopause.
-   **Partner Support**: A linked-account feature with strict, user-controlled privacy settings.
-   **Community & Events**: Simple topic-based groups and an events list.
-   **Specialists Directory**: A Find a Specialist screen with profiles and external booking links.
-   **Push Notifications**: For reminders and partner alerts.
-   **Branding**: Primary color: Red, Accent color: Green, based on the provided logo.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been created using Expo (React Native) for the frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB for the backend.
-   **Backend**: A comprehensive  file contains all necessary Pydantic models and API endpoints for users, symptoms, articles, community features, and more. The database has been seeded with initial data for symptoms and articles. JWT-based registration and login are functional.
-   **Frontend**: The entire application structure has been scaffolded using . All screens and components exist as files, though most are placeholder shells. Core navigation, state management with Zustand (), and constants (like brand colors) are in place. The welcome, login, and registration screens are visually implemented.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: Implementing Google Social Login. The backend endpoint () has been created, and the frontend has been updated with a Sign in with Google button on the login/register screens, along with the necessary state management and service logic using . The agent just restarted the services after adding the code.
-   Status: **IN PROGRESS**
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? The next agent should first ask the user for the necessary Google Cloud credentials. After configuring them, the agent should perform manual testing of the end-to-end flow using the web preview. A screenshot should be taken of the updated login screen to show the new button.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Complete and Test Google Authentication (P0)

Issues Detail:
-   Issue 1:
    -   Description: The code for Google Authentication has been added to both the frontend and backend, but it is not functional. The agent has hardcoded placeholder values for  and  in . The entire flow is untested.
    -   Attempted fixes: None. This is the first implementation attempt.
    -   Next debug checklist:
        1.  **Ask User for Credentials**: The agent MUST ask the user to provide the  and  for the web application.
        2.  **Update Environment**: Create a  file in the  directory and add the credentials there (e.g., , ).
        3.  **Refactor **: Modify  to load these credentials from the environment variables instead of using hardcoded placeholders.
        4.  **Restart Backend**: Restart the backend service to apply the new environment variables.
        5.  **Test Flow**: Manually test the Sign in with Google button from the app preview. Verify the redirect to Google, successful login, and redirect back to the app, resulting in a logged-in state.
    -   Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will fulfill a key user requirement for an alternative, seamless login method, improving the user onboarding experience.
    -   Status: IN PROGRESS
    -   Is recurring issue? N
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: Both. The fix involves backend configuration and a full frontend user flow.
    -   Blocked on other issue: No. Blocked on user input (credentials).

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks in progress. The Google Auth implementation is the sole focus.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **P0**: Implement Push Notifications using Expo Push Notifications for reminders and partner alerts.
    -   **P1**: Implement the Partner / Spouse / Family Support linked account flow. This involves creating the invitation logic, defining data-sharing permissions, and building out the partner's dashboard view.
    -   **P1**: Flesh out all scaffolded frontend screens with functional UI and API integrations (e.g., Symptom Logging, Mood/Lifestyle Tracking, History/Insights view, Library browsing, Community interaction).
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **P2**: Create a basic admin interface/dashboard for the Adelphi team to manage content (symptoms, articles, events) as requested by the user.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Backend**:
    -   Established FastAPI backend with MongoDB connection.
    -   Created all data models (Pydantic) for the entire application scope in .
    -   Implemented all CRUD API endpoints for users, symptoms, articles, logs, etc., in .
    -   Implemented a database seeding script that populates initial data on startup.
    -   Implemented JWT-based user registration () and login ().
-   **Frontend**:

-   **Documentation**:
    -   Created an initial  file.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None were identified in the session.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   Issue recurrence in previous fork: None.
-   Recurrence count: 0
-   Status: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, Expo Router (file-based routing), Zustand (state management),  (for web-based OAuth).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic (data modeling/validation), MongoDB (database),  (for JWT).
-   **Authentication**: Dual approach with JWT (email/password) and OAuth 2.0 (Google Sign-In).

**key DB schema**
The schema is defined by Pydantic models in :
-   : {email, name, hashed_password, age_range, ethnicity, etc.}
-   : {name, description, category, reviewed, etc.}
-   : {title, content, category, author, etc.}
-   : {user_id, symptom_id, severity, frequency, notes, etc.}
-   : {user_id, mood_score, emotions, description, etc.}
-   : {name, description}
-   : {group_id, user_id, content}
-   : {title, description, date, location}
-   : {name, speciality, bio, contact}

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The single source of truth for all backend logic, models, and API endpoints.
-   : Defines the application's color palette, recently updated to match brand logo.
-   : Zustand store managing user authentication state, token, and login/logout actions.
-   : New file containing the client-side logic for the Google authentication flow.
-   : Root layout component that controls navigation based on authentication status.
-   : Login screen, updated with the Sign in with Google button.
-   : Registration screen, updated with the Sign in with Google button.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The immediate and most critical task is to resolve the Google Authentication implementation. You **must** ask the user for the  and  for their web application. The previous agent hardcoded placeholders in . You need to modify the backend to securely load these keys from environment variables ( file) and then test the entire end-to-end login flow. Do not proceed with other features until Google Login is confirmed to be working.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   **User Message (latest)**: Find attached the Adelphe brand logo, use thesame colour style, but the red colour on the logo should be the primary colour, then integrate google authentication login. The user attached an image of the logo.
    -   **Status**: In Progress. The agent has updated the colors and written the code for Google auth, but it is not yet functional or tested.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: Google Authentication is non-functional due to missing credentials.
-   **Mocked**: None. The app uses a live backend with a seeded database.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Google Sign-In**: For user authentication. This requires a User-provided API Key (Google Cloud  and ).

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: None.
-   Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **JWT Login**: The agent used  with password  in  tests.
-   **Google Login**: **Requires user-provided  and .**

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent forgot to ask the user for the necessary  and  to complete the Google Authentication feature. It implemented the code with placeholder values, leaving the feature non-functional.
